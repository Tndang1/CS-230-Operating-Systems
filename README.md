# CS-230-Operating-Systems

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is seeking to create a web-browser based game to match their existing mobile app game.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I felt I did decent understanding the constraints and design requirements for the system. It was important to keep in mind that the game is meant to be ran on a browser, so design decisions needed to be made that would provide that compatibility.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Constraints and domain models helped in creating a frame from which to develop code. Without these I would have been working from a blank canvas. Considering trying to develop in a team, a blank canvas start couldeasily lead to numerous extra meetings and conflicts in the code that needed to be resolved, instead of all developers having an idea what needed to happen and how to do so.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The evaluation portion of the document could use revision. Some of the description I provided on different operating systems does not provide information that is helpful to making a decision on the system, so I would want to highlight reasons to use, or not use, a system for that funciton better.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting user needs begin by understand what the user wants out of the software. Then we can consider why the user wants this, until we reach a point of what the user needs from the software to satisfy the want. If the software does not provide for the needs of the user, it will fail to provide what the user wants and not be a useful application.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

By reviewing the requirements, constraints, and diagrams, I had a clear roadmap on how the program needed to be built. From there it was easy to make decisions on how to implement features and what technologies to use. In future projects I will continue with making sure I understand what the application needs to do by understanding what the user wants from it before I begin work.
